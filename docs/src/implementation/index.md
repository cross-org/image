# Implementation Notes

---

This section contains detailed technical notes about the pure JavaScript
implementations of various image format encoders and decoders in @cross/image.

These documents provide insights into:

- Current implementation status
- Technical approach and algorithms
- Known limitations and future improvements
- Format-specific considerations

## Available Documentation

- [JPEG Implementation](jpeg-implementation.md) - Baseline DCT encoder/decoder
  details
- [WebP Implementation](webp-implementation.md) - VP8L lossless codec details
- [TIFF Implementation](tiff-implementation.md) - TIFF 6.0 with LZW compression
  details

If you're interested in contributing to format implementations or understanding
how they work under the hood, these pages are for you.
