# Implementation Notes

This section contains technical notes about the pure JavaScript implementations of image format
encoders and decoders in @cross/image.

These documents provide insights into implementation status, algorithms, limitations, and
format-specific considerations.

## Available Documentation

- [JPEG Implementation](jpeg-implementation.md) - Baseline DCT encoder/decoder
- [WebP Implementation](webp-implementation.md) - VP8L lossless codec
- [TIFF Implementation](tiff-implementation.md) - TIFF 6.0 with LZW compression
- [GIF Implementation](gif-implementation.md) - GIF87a/GIF89a with LZW and animation

If you're interested in contributing to format implementations or understanding how they work, these
pages are for you.
